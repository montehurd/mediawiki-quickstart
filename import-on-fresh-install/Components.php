# Quickstart copies this file into the Mediawiki folder
# it clones. Mediawiki's LocalSettings.php is made to include
# this file. When components (skins/extensions) are installed,
# includes to their respective LocalSettings.php files will
# be added to this file by the installer. Probably do not
# modify this file directly.
